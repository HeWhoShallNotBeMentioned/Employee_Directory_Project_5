#### By _**{Chris Underwood}**_

## Description

_{ 12 random "employees" are pulled from randomuser.me api. They basic data is put into "cards" that are displayed on the page. Each card has is created with a modal with more employee detail. Once a modal is opened, arrow buttons are provided to allow seeing all employee modals by scrolling. Going from last to first and vis-versa is supported. There is a search function that searches the 12 users on each key-up in the employee name and userlogin. The search also brings back users when individual letters or the entire search is removed.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

Download the files and open index.html. As a live API is being used, an open internet connection is required for the program to operate. There are also multiple CDNs that require an internet connection.


## Known Bugs

_{ When using the search feature, if a modal is opened, the model left/right arrows still used the original 12 cards and not the search results. }_
